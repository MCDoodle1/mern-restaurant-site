## Overview

The tutorial consists of 100 video's
that create a user and admin dashboard on a Restaurant site where the user 
can order and pay for food and the administrator can create and change products
and product categories (CRUD functionality). 

The course explains how to set up the backend and frontend (MongoDB, Express,
React and Node) and how to connect them. 

One third into the course the trainer decides to introduce Redux for state
management. It was interesting to see the changes needed for this, although 
the Redux version that is used is not the recommended version at the time of
writing this (March 2024). The course was made between March 2020 and May 2023.
The recommended Redux version in 2024 is Redux Toolkit.

## My process

I did not create my own process for this challenge, but followed along with the 
instructor. I realize that following a YouTube tutorial is not the best way to 
learn, but this was my first MERN project and although I cannot yet create a MERN
project on my own, I learned a lot.
